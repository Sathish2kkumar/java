covered query 

means creating the index for the particular field that we are going to use in query while matching.
using indexing for the fields makes query faster run comparing to the normal queries 
note:indexing doesn't support if condition queries or else methods used in the query eg:$gt,$lt like this queries indexing will not work 

Regular expressions or negation operators like $nin, $not, etc.
Arithmetic operators like $mod, etc.
$where clause


A collection cannot have more than 64 indexes.
The length of the index name cannot be longer than 125 characters.
A compound index can have maximum 31 fields indexed.


RAM Usage
Since indexes are stored in RAM, you should make sure that the total size of the index does not exceed the RAM limit. If the total size increases the RAM size, it will start deleting some indexes, causing performance loss.

analyzing queries

Analyzing queries is a very important aspect of measuring how effective the database and indexing design is. We will learn about the frequently used $explain and $hint queries.

$explain
db.users.find({gender:"M"},{user_name:1,_id:0}).explain()

The true value of indexOnly indicates that this query has used indexing.

The cursor field specifies the type of cursor used. BTreeCursor type indicates that an index was used and also gives the name of the index used. BasicCursor indicates that a full scan was made without using any indexes.

n indicates the number of documents matching returned.

nscannedObjects indicates the total number of documents scanned.

nscanned indicates the total number of documents or index entries scanned.



$hint
The $hint operator forces the query optimizer to use the specified index to run a query. This is particularly useful when you want to test performance of a query with different indexes. For example, the following query specifies the index on fields gender and user_name to be used for this query


db.users.find({gender:"M"},{user_name:1,_id:0}).hint({gender:1,user_name:1})
{ "user_name" : "tombenzamin" }


ObjectId
An ObjectId is a 12-byte BSON type having the following structure

The first 4 bytes representing the seconds since the unix epoch
The next 3 bytes are the machine identifier
The next 2 bytes consists of process id
The last 3 bytes are a random counter value
