The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern used in object-oriented programming to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client. Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you use a special factory method.


Centralizes Object Creation Logic – Instead of creating objects all over your code, you have one centralized method or class responsible for it.

Promotes Loose Coupling – The client code only depends on an interface or abstract class, not the concrete implementation.

Better Maintainability – Easily change object creation logic without affecting other parts of the system.

Scalability – You can introduce new classes without changing the existing codebase much.
