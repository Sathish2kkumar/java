 When to Use the Adapter Pattern?
You want to use a class, but its interface is incompatible with your code.

You want to reuse existing code without modifying it.

You're working with legacy code or third-party libraries.

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
